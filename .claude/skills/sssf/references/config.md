# Config Reference

The full `sssf.config.yaml` spec: every field, how defaults merge, and how model / thinking / tools / extensions map onto the coding agent.

It lives at **`adws/adw_sssf_config/sssf.config.yaml`** — the default path every `adw_*.py` and the justfile resolve, and where `install.py` / `make_config.py` stamp it. Pass `--config <path>` to any ADW (or set `SSSF_CONFIG` for the justfile) to run against a different roster.

## Fields

### `defaults`

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `coding_agent` | `pi` \| `claude_code` | Which interface runs the agent. `pi` talks to model-provider APIs (per-token). `claude_code` shells out to the real `claude` CLI — one persistent process per agent phase, first-party auth. |
| `claude_code_auth` | `subscription` \| `api_key` | `claude_code` only. `subscription` strips `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the child so `claude` uses its cached `claude login` (draws the Claude plan window); `api_key` passes the key through (per-token Console billing). Default `subscription`. Env override: `SSSF_CLAUDE_AUTH`. |
| `claude_code_system` | `append` \| `replace` | `claude_code` only. `append` (default, **supported**) keeps Claude Code's ~14k default system prompt and adds the agent's `system.md` via `--append-system-prompt`. `replace` drops the default entirely — the only system text is `claude_code_system_prompt_file` + the agent's `system.md`, via `--system-prompt`. `replace` is an unsupported, model-version-fragile escape hatch: you re-own every operating rule (Read-before-Edit, Grep/Glob over shell, path rules, no interactive flags, output terseness). Env override: `SSSF_CLAUDE_SYSTEM`. **Measure before adopting** — with the persistent process the ~14k prefix is already a cache *read* (~0.1× against the window), and `append` + `claude_code_exclude_dynamic_sections` draws the window *less* than `replace` in testing while keeping Claude's guidance. The real bloat lever is `tools` (below), not this. |
| `claude_code_system_prompt_file` | path | `claude_code` only. Markdown file used as the base system prompt in `replace` mode (ignored in `append`). Repo-relative, resolved from cwd. A starter is stamped at `adws/adw_sssf_config/claude_system.md` — edit it, don't regenerate. `replace` mode with no readable file fails validation. |
| `claude_code_exclude_dynamic_sections` | bool | `claude_code` only, `append` mode only. Passes `--exclude-dynamic-system-prompt-sections` — moves the per-machine sections (cwd, env, git status) out of the cached system-prompt prefix into the first user message, for lighter and more cache-friendly turns. Default `true`. |
| `model` | string | Model id. For Pi, any id registered in `~/.pi/agent/models.json`. For `claude_code`, `anthropic/<id>` or a bare id/alias (`claude-sonnet-5`, `sonnet`) — see `agent_cc._CLAUDE_MODELS`. Default `gemini-3.6-flash`. |
| `thinking` | enum | Reasoning effort — see below. Default `medium`. |
| `color` | hex string | Lane color for every agent that does not set its own. Default empty — the visualizer falls back to its own palette. |
| `harness_engineering` | list[string] | Coding-agent extensions. Pi: extension names. Claude Code: reserved (MCP, hooks). |
| `tools` | list[string] | Roster-wide tool allowlist. Every agent that omits its own `tools` inherits this. Unset = all tools usable. Under `claude_code` a non-empty list is passed as **both** `--allowedTools` (pre-approve, no prompt) and `--tools` (drop the schemas of every builtin not listed — the real per-turn token-bloat cut, ~13k→~7k in testing). `tools` unset = the full Claude builtin set. |
| `protected_files` | list[string] | Paths **no** agent may modify unless it names them in its own `writes`. Default: `adws/adw_modules/`, `adws/adw_sssf_config/`, `adws/adw_*.py` — an agent must not be able to edit the machinery that decides whether its work passed. |
| `data_dir` | path | Runtime home. Sessions land at `{data_dir}/sessions/{adw_id}/{agent_name}/`. Default `adws/adw_data`. |

### `observability`

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `db` | path | SQLite trace db. `tracer.py` writes it directly; the visualizer polls it. Default `adws/adw_data/sssf.db`. |
| `poll_ms` | int | Visualizer live-poll cadence in ms. History uses the same queries, lazy-paged. Default `500`. |

### `agents[]`

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | The identifier ADW scripts use. **ADWs name agents, never models.** |
| `purpose` | yes | One sentence: what this agent is for. Should match its `system.md` Purpose. |
| `prompt_engineering.system` | yes | Path to the system prompt — who the agent is, its single purpose, its output contract. |
| `prompt_engineering.user` | yes | Path to the default user prompt — the task template with `{{prompt}}`, `{{previous_envelope}}`, `{{context_handoff_dir}}`. |
| `color` | no | Hex swatch (`"#a78bfa"`) for this agent's lane in the visualizer. Travels config → `agent_sessions.color` → `/api/sessions/:adw_id`, and rides the `agent_start` event so a lane is colored while the agent is still running. Unset = the UI's fallback palette. |
| `coding_agent`, `model`, `thinking`, `color`, `harness_engineering` | no | Override the corresponding `defaults` key. |
| `tools` | no | Allowlist. **Omitting the key means all tools usable.** A capability list, not a boundary — see `writes`. |
| `writes` | no | What this agent may modify **in the repo**, enforced after every call. Omitted = unrestricted (still barred from `protected_files`). `[]` = no repo writes at all. A list = only those paths: a trailing `/` is a directory prefix, `*` matches within one path segment, `**` crosses segments, anything else is an exact path. Naming a `protected_files` path here is what unlocks it. **The session runtime under `data_dir` is always writable** — `writes: []` means read-only with respect to the repo, not unable to write its own report. |

Output types are deliberately absent: config defines who an agent *is*; the ADW call site defines how it's *used*. One agent serves many calls — same system prompt, different user prompt + output type per call.

## Defaults merging

`agents.py` merges each entry **over** `defaults`, key by key. An entry states only what differs; anything unset inherits. `agents.validate(cfg, REQUIRED_AGENTS)` then confirms every name an ADW declares exists, resolves to a usable coding agent + model, and has both prompt files present on disk. Any miss fails the run immediately — **no agent is ever spawned against a half-valid config.**

## Thinking levels

Pi's reasoning-effort ladder, lowest to highest:

```
off | minimal | low | medium | high | xhigh | max
```

Mapped to Pi's reasoning effort control and honored when the model is registered with `reasoning: true` in `~/.pi/agent/models.json`. On a non-reasoning model the setting is inert — no error, no effect. Rough guidance: `high`/`xhigh` for planners and reviewers, `medium` for builders, `low` for mechanical read-and-report agents. (For Claude Code in v2, the same field maps to the thinking budget.)

## Model resolution

**Always write `model` as `provider/model-id`.** `agents.py` hands the string to the Pi interface, which resolves it against pi's merged catalog — `~/.pi/agent/models.json` plus pi's built-in providers. The same model is usually carried by more than one provider (`gemini-3.6-flash` lives under `google` *and* under `openrouter` as `google/gemini-3.6-flash`), and a bare id that matches several **raises at resolution**:

```
agent 'scout': model pattern 'gemini-3.6-flash' is ambiguous:
  [('google', 'gemini-3.6-flash'), ('openrouter', 'google/gemini-3.6-flash'), ...]
```

That is `agents.validate()` doing its job — it fails before anything spawns rather than silently billing the wrong provider — but it means every agent in the roster inheriting that default is grounded until the pattern is qualified. Qualifying is the whole fix: `google/gemini-3.6-flash`, `openai/gpt-5.6-terra`, `fireworks/accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k3`. The leading segment is matched against the provider list first, so the rest of the string can contain slashes.

Other consequences worth knowing:

- A model must be in the catalog before any agent can name it. An unknown id fails at resolution, before spawn. `pi --list-models` is the catalog the resolver actually reads.
- **Ambiguity can appear without you touching the config.** Registering a new provider that carries a model you already use turns a formerly-fine bare pattern ambiguous. If a roster stops validating and nobody edited it, that is why.
- Provider credentials come from the environment, not the config — the key that matches the provider you named (`GEMINI_API_KEY` for `google/...`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for `openrouter/...`).
- The resolved model is recorded per session in `agent_map.json` and mirrored into the `agent_sessions` table. **Changing an agent's model invalidates its session**: a joined run starts that agent fresh instead of resuming a context window built by a different model.

## Tools

`tools` maps to `pi --tools`. Pi's seven builtin tool names:

| Tool | Purpose | Pi's own default |
|---|---|---|
| `read` | read file contents | on |
| `bash` | execute bash commands | on |
| `edit` | find/replace edits | on |
| `write` | create/overwrite files | on |
| `grep` | search file contents | **off** |
| `find` | find files by glob | **off** |
| `ls` | list directory contents | **off** |

`grep`, `find`, and `ls` are off in bare Pi, so an agent that does not name them will shell out through `bash` to do the same work. The starter roster therefore sets `defaults.tools` to all seven and lets each agent narrow from there.

### Under `claude_code`

The same pi names are translated to Claude tool names for `--allowedTools` / `--tools`:

| pi | Claude |
|---|---|
| `read` | `Read` |
| `write` | `Write` |
| `edit` | `Edit` |
| `bash` | `Bash` |
| `grep` | `Grep` |
| `find` | `Glob` |
| `ls` | `Read` (Claude lists via `Read` on a dir) |
| `subagent_*` | dropped (warn once — no Claude equivalent; planner/scout recon runs serially) |

Unknown names pass through verbatim. A non-empty list also becomes `--tools`, which removes the *schemas* of every unlisted builtin (`TodoWrite`, `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, `Task`, `NotebookEdit`, …) — that is where the per-turn token saving comes from. Leave `tools` unset to keep Claude's full builtin set.

**Resolution order:** an agent's own `tools` list wins; an agent that omits the key inherits `defaults.tools`; if neither is set, `tools` stays `None` and all tools are usable. An empty list is not "all tools" — it is a tool-less agent, and it will stall.

## Write permissions — `writes` and `protected_files`

`tools` cannot express a safety boundary, because two of the tools are general
purpose. `bash` runs anything, including `git checkout`, which discards an
engineer's uncommitted work; `write` reaches any path, not only the one report
file an agent was granted it for. So "this agent changes nothing" is a claim a
tool list can state but never keep.

`adw_modules/permissions.py` keeps it, the same way every other claim in this
system is kept — after the fact, against the repo. Before an agent's first
prompt the working tree's change-set is fingerprinted; after its last send
(including JSON retries and gate corrections) it is fingerprinted again. Any
path that appeared, vanished, or changed is attributed to that agent.

Comparing change-sets rather than watching writes is deliberate: a path that was
modified before the agent ran and is clean afterwards has been **reverted**, and
a reversion is a modification. That is what catches `git checkout`.

A breach is not a gate violation. Gates are for work an agent can be asked to
redo; a write has already happened, so re-prompting fixes nothing. Instead:

1. every unauthorized change the agent **introduced** is rolled back — tracked
   files with `git checkout --`, untracked files by deletion;
2. a path that was **already dirty** before the agent ran is left untouched. The
   operator had uncommitted work there, and discarding it to tidy up would be
   the same harm this module exists to prevent;
3. the phase fails and names every path with what happened to it.

```yaml
defaults:
  protected_files: [adws/adw_modules/, adws/adw_sssf_config/, "adws/adw_*.py"]

agents:
  - name: builder      # no `writes` key -> unrestricted, minus protected_files
  - name: scout
    writes: []         # no repo writes; its findings still land in context_handoff/
  - name: planner
    writes: [specs/]
  - name: documenter
    writes: [app_docs/, docs/, "**/*.md", "*.md"]
```

**The session runtime under `data_dir` is always writable, for every agent.**
`context_handoff/` is how agents hand work to each other, and each agent's
prompts, `raw_output.jsonl`, and `envelope.json` sit beside it. That grant comes
from `data_dir` rather than from `.gitignore`: the runtime is normally ignored,
so it never even appears in a snapshot, but an agent's ability to record its own
work must not depend on a gitignore line someone can delete.

Narrow by role, not by reflex. Anything that must produce a `context_handoff/` artifact needs `write`, or it will resort to a `bash` heredoc. Withhold `edit`/`write` only where the restriction *is* the guarantee — a reviewer that cannot edit cannot quietly fix what it was asked to report.

### Extension tools must be named explicitly

`pi --tools` is an allowlist over **built-in, extension, and custom tools alike** — not just builtins. So the moment an agent has a `tools` list at all (its own, or one inherited from `defaults`), any tool registered by its `harness_engineering` extensions is **excluded unless it appears in that list by name**.

This fails quietly. The extension still loads, the run still succeeds, and the tool the extension exists to provide is simply never offered to the model — you find out by noticing the agent never called it.

```yaml
  - name: reviewer
    harness_engineering:
      - .pi/extensions/ast_query.ts     # registers tool: ast_query
    tools:
      - read
      - grep
      - find
      - ls
      - bash
      - ast_query                       # REQUIRED — the extension's tool, named or lost
```

Rule: **every entry in `harness_engineering` that registers a tool must have that tool name added to the agent's `tools` list.** Adding an extension is therefore a two-line change, never one. The alternative is dropping the `tools` key *and* leaving `defaults.tools` unset so the agent resolves to `None` (all tools) — but with a roster-wide `defaults.tools` in place, that escape hatch is closed; naming the tool is the only path.

## Harness engineering

`harness_engineering` entries are pi extension **file paths**, passed through as `pi -e <path>`, one flag per entry, scoped to that agent only. This is where per-agent harness changes live — e.g. an output-tightening extension for an agent that keeps wrapping its envelope in prose. The starter roster ships with none. On Claude Code the field is reserved for MCP config and hooks in v2.

**If the extension registers a tool, name that tool in the agent's `tools` list too** — `--tools` filters extension tools exactly like builtins, so an unnamed extension tool is silently unavailable no matter that the extension loaded fine. See [Extension tools must be named explicitly](#extension-tools-must-be-named-explicitly) above. Extensions that only shape output or add flags (no tool registration) need no `tools` change.
